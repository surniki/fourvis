General Relativity predicts that light rays travel along paths that
are determined by the spacetime metric. The metric used to analyze the
space around the black hole is the Schwarzschild metric. Although the
Schwarzschild metric does not describe the spacetime geometry for the
region where the coordinate radius is less than the Schwarzschild
radius, it is appropriate to use this simple metric because the light
rays that enter the region inside of the Schwarzschild radius will
enter into a plunge orbit. Therefore, those instances do not need to
be simulated here, as it will have no effect on the image
produced. Instead, it is reasoned that the light rays with an impact
parameter that is less than the Schwarzschild radius will inevitably
enter into a plunge orbit. It follows that the light rays within the
region can be omitted from the simulation since the outcome is known
already.

The paths taken by the light rays around a black hole are described by
the differential equations:

which are derived from the Schwarzschild metric and listed as
equations (9.59) and (9.63) in "Gravity: An introduction to Einstein's
General Relativity" by James B. Hartle. Note that the angular momentum
and the impact parameter are constants due to the spherical symmetry
present in the Schwarzschild metric. These differential equations
describe the change in the radial and the azimuthal angle coordinates
with respect to the affine parameter. The two differential equations
are simplified by absorbing the angular momentum term into the affine
parameter, yielding the following equations that are numerically
integrating in the simulation.
