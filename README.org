General Relativity predicts that light rays travel along paths that
are determined by the spacetime metric. The metric used to analyze the
space around the black hole is the Schwarzschild metric. Although the
Schwarzschild metric does not describe the spacetime geometry for the
region where the coordinate radius is less than the Schwarzschild
radius, it is appropriate to use this simple metric because the light
rays that enter the region inside of the Schwarzschild radius will
enter into a plunge orbit. Therefore, those instances do not need to
be simulated here, as it will have no effect on the image
produced. Instead, we reason that the light rays with an impact
parameter that is less than the Schwarzschild radius will inevitably
enter into a plunge orbit and choose not to simulate those light rays
at all.

The paths taken by the light rays around a black hole are described by
the differential equations:
